                        Hello and welcome to our Holderness Volleyball Club. Our name comes from the fact that originally we 
                        used to play from the South Holderness School in Preston but we have now moved into the Woodford Leisure Centre 
                        on Holderness Road in Hull which worked <br>out pretty well for us as it meant we did not need to change our name. 
                        The club has been running for around 20 years now and that time has seen some faces come and go, some have
                        retired, some have moved away from this city whilst others have come <br>here from other cities or in several cases, 
                        from other countries.
        
                    </p>
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <img src="../imgs/pic1.jpg" class="img-fluid" height="400px" style="display:block;">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-5" id="about_us_text">
                        <p>
                            The founder is George Dickson pictures on
                            the back row – far right of the picture, he still 
                            maintains interest in the club and pops
                            in from time to time but George has more or 
                            less retired and misses playing very much – once 
                            you play Volleyball, it does not usually leave 
                            your blood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After this time the club was run for a while by Alan 
                            Grayson who gave the club a good three / four 
                            seasons of good volleyball including in 2015 the 
                            title winning team and a second place in the 
                            Yorkshire League.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A ridiculous rule robbed us of the title that season as the team that won it won by a single point which was robbed from 
                            us because we were one hour late to re-arrange a fixture away at their venue. Needless to say if that is the only way 
                            some teams can win then some of them certainly will do so but our local league fortunately is not run like this, nor 
                            does it operate like this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our local teams are all equally respectful of one another and we have a great time when we play each other.
                        </p>

                            Alan is wearing the no.1 shirt on this picture with George on the Rear-Far Left this time. 
                            After the departure of Alan, it was taken over by Simon (Rear next to George) and Liz with Jenny 
                            following soon after as well as the two Dave’s (Coaches)
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            We are still now in this period of Simon, Liz, Jenny, Dave, Dave and Rob, each of these six people contribute 
                            is some way to the running of the club but the overall policy of the club has changed now. There is no longer anyone in 
                            overall charge of running the club, we have decided as a group to become a club run by it’s members for it’s members 
                            with anyone who wants to assist in anything to do with the operating part of the club only needing to put themselves 
                            forward and there will be a role for them and we highly encourage this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since making this decision, the club has become much more fun, we have a very relaxed atmosphere, our finances are good, 
                            the overall ship is very stable and it shows in what happens week-in, week-out during training at Woodford.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The league is also now run differently too and Wayne has managed to make it an extremely nice atmosphere in which to play, 
                            so much so that we now have a small waiting list for clubs outside of the city wishing to join the league next season whom 
                            are all prepared to travel to our area in order to participate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, now on to our club specifically and where it is today….. we operate an open policy to everyone, no matter what level of 
                            ability you are, we have the time and resources to literally help and train absolutely anyone who wants to play this beautiful game. 
                            We are a properly registered club with ‘Volleyball England’ – the sports Governing body.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the coming season we are looking for at least four categories of player ready for the coming season but if you fancy giving it a try 
                            then you will not feel any pressure as you can play just for fun if you wish without having to play the games in the season. If however 
                            you have a desire to play in the proper matches then we operate a system whereby everyone starts in the same place and has to work their 
                            way up to play in the top team if that is what they desire but we have players who are more than happy to play in the other teams due to 
                            the nice pleasant relaxed atmosphere and the lack of pressure to win so as you can see we have different scenarios which we are sure will 
                            suit everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our training sessions run all year round pausing only for the Christmas Break and Good Friday so we are at Woodford every week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Call in for a look at us playing and then decide if you fancy giving it a go, especially if you have never tried this sport before, we believe 
                            that once you start, you will become hooked and it will be in your DNA very quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to speak to someone first then go to the CONTACT page and contact either Simon, Liz or Jenny and we will help you every step of the way.
                        </p>
                        <p>We hope to see you very soon at WOODFORD LEISURE CENTRE on HOLDERNESS ROAD – just outside of EAST PARK.</p>
